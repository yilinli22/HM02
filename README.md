## Graph 1. Nobel Prizes in Countries

This graph compares the number of Nobel Prizes awarded to countries around the world. The data set uses country code. As shown in the bar chart, among these *18* countries, there have been nine residents in 'DE' (Bavaria) who have been awarded Nobel Prize before. There are many other countries in the data set, [check it out](http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/country.json )!
## Graph 2. Population growth China vs. Japan

I'm curious about how different is the population growth rate like among different countries. In this graph, China's population grwoth is way faster than that of Japan. But it tends to slow down coming closer to year 2000. Interestingly, after I compare China with developed countries including France and the U.S., those graphs are very similar to the one here. If you want to know more, I found [this](https://www.csdojo.io/data) data set which contains population data over years. Definitely check it out!
